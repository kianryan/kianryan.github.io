In the mornings I <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/2506957/">run, swim, and cycle</a>.</p>

        <p>A few years ago I did my first Sprint Triathlon.  I was terrible, and decided that needed to change.  So I spent the time learning to swim (still a long way to go), learning to run (still a long way to go), and then went back to racing last year.  I completed three Sprint races in 2017.  2018 I'm planning on two Sprint and a Standard distance race.</p>

        <p>I also do 10K races.</p>

During the day I <a href="https://github.com/kianryan/">tap away at a keyboard</a>. <a href="http://www.orangetentacle.co.uk">People pay me for this.</a>

        <p>I had a priviledged start in coding.</p>
        <p>I literally cut my teeth on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum.</p>
        <p>My primary school had a BBC Micro.  I spent hours on it.</p>
        <p>A teacher introduced me to Pascal and C in the first few years of Secondary education.</p>
        <p>I was driven and interested enough to learn as much as I could.</p>
        <p>I went to university, learned some more.  Made funny faces at Java.</p>
        <p>I graduated, started working, then really started to learn.</p>
        <p>I've been writing code for a long time.  It's hard to remember a time when I haven't been writing code of some description.</p>
        <p>I now freelance and consult for a living, working on interesting projects.  <a href="http://www.orangetentacle.co.uk/">I love hearing about interesting projects.</a></p>

In the evenings, I teach people to hit each other with metal sticks.</p>

        <p>I'm a fencing coach.  I teach people the sport of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTw05gC2T9Y&t=5s">fencing.</a></p>
        <p>I've been fencing for 20 years, and coaching for a large part of that.  As my career has progressed, I've spent more time developing my coaching and less time competing.  I am now completely focussed on coaching.  I've worked with a range of outstanding coaches and taken advantage of some excellent learning opportunities.  I now work with a number of clubs in the North West.  You can find where I'm currently coaching on the <a href="/now">Now</a> page.</p>

        <p>I'm married to <a href="http://twitter.com/catashton">Cat</a>.  <a href="http://www.catashton.co.uk">Her blog lives over here</a>.</p>
        <p>Here's a photo of the pair of us just before the Birmingham Triathlon in 2017:</p>

        <p>We have three cats - in order of seniority: Walnut, Cinder and Maple.</p>
        <p>Because it would be rude to not have a cat photo, have a rare photo of all three of them sleeping:</p>
