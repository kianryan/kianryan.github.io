In the mornings I <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/2506957/">run, swim, and cycle</a>.</p>

        <p>A few years ago I did my first Sprint Triathlon.  I was terrible, and decided that needed to change.  So I spent the time learning to
            swim (still a long way to go), learning to run (still a long way to go), and then went back to racing.  I moved from sprint, to standard,
            and middle.  2021 sees me tacking iron distance.

During the day I <a href="https://github.com/kianryan/">tap away at a keyboard</a>. <a href="http://www.orangetentacle.co.uk">People pay me for this.</a>

        <p>I had a priviledged start in coding.</p>
        <p>I literally cut my teeth on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum.</p>
        <p>My primary school had a BBC Micro.  I spent hours on it.</p>
        <p>A teacher introduced me to Pascal and C in the first few years of Secondary education.</p>
        <p>I was driven and interested enough to learn as much as I could.</p>
        <p>I went to university, learned some more.  Made funny faces at Java.</p>
        <p>I graduated, started working, then really started to learn.</p>
        <p>I've been writing code for a long time.  It's hard to remember a time when I haven't been writing code of some description.</p>
        <p>I now freelance and consult for a living, working on interesting projects.  <a href="http://www.orangetentacle.co.uk/">I love hearing about interesting projects.</a></p>

On the weekends I do the above, and sometimes run and speak at events.</p>

        <p>I've organised and spoken at Geekups, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">Barcamps</a>, and taken part in a few Hackdays.</p>

        <p>I'm passionate about coaching and teaching.  I've led sessions for kids on robotics, lego, programming and soldering as part of several
            initiatives, including the excellent <a href="https://www.devoxx4kids.org/">Devoxx4Kids</a>.</p>

        <p>I believe education should be fun, which is why I was stood in a marquee tent at the <a href="https://womad.co.uk/">WOMAD</a> festival
            dressed as a Hogwarts teacher in tweeds, on one of the hottest days of the year, waving around
            <a href="https://kano.me/uk/store/products/coding-wand">accelerometer wands</a>.</p>

        <p>I used to teach people fencing.  I'm having a break for now.</p>

        <p>I'm was a member of the <a href="https://2018.dwcon.org/">2016 and 2016 Discworld Convention Committee.</a></p>

I'm married, live in North West England and have three cats.</p>

        <p>I'm married to <a href="http://twitter.com/catashton">Cat</a>.  <a href="http://www.catashton.co.uk">Her blog lives over here</a>.</p>
        <p>Here's a photo of the pair of us just before the Birmingham Triathlon in 2017:</p>

        <p>We have three cats - in order of seniority: Walnut, Cinder and Maple.</p>
        <p>Because it would be rude to not have a cat photo, have a rare photo of all three of them sleeping:</p>
