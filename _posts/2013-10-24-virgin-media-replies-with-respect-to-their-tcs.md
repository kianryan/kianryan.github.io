    For those unfamiliar, Virgin Media has a potentially very wide reaching clause in their [T&Cs (Section D, Part 1, Line h)](http://store.virginmedia.com/the-legal-stuff/terms-and-conditions-for-fibre-optic-services.html#responsible).  I wrote about it [here](http://www.kianryan.co.uk/2013/10/checking-your-work-e-mail-on-virgin-media-residential-could-get-you-cut-off/).  I was quite surprised by how much noise this generated, journalists (who could be affected over this) have been discussing it on Twitter.
    
    Virgin Media have replied a few times to the original post, and I asked them to clarify a few points.  Their latest response is given below.  They agree there's confusion over this particular part of their T&Cs, and have sent it to the relevant teams for investigation.  Jim says he'll keep me updated on the progress, and in turn, I'll post those updates here.

    > As before, we have no objections to people using Virgin Media broadband when working from home – e.g. connecting to their work VPN. But we ask people not to use our residential service as their main business connection as business use often requires dedicated connections and support. If we need to talk to someone about how they’re using their residential service for business purposes, we won’t disconnect them but simply focus on getting the customer the package that’s right for them.
