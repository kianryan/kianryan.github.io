Well, I didn&#8217;t see that coming.

I posted the following whilst on the train in to Manchester today:

Do something nice for your Freelancers today, pay their invoices." title="It's Freelancers day..." width="545" height="262" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-520" />](http://twitter.com/#!/kianryan/status/7004047055790080)

Possibly a little flippant, but touched on a nerve that effects a lot of freelancer &#8211; poor payers. Every freelancer has good payers and poor payers, and the poor payers are a continual fly in an otherwise quite pleasant ointment. My little remark must have sounded a note with my freelancing brethren, since as soon as I posted it, my phone started buzzing with people (manually) re-tweeting.

And with Twitter&#8217;s native re-tweet function, it&#8217;s just hit 95 from 91 whilst I&#8217;ve typed this post. That&#8217;s not an epic amount of traffic (not even close), but it&#8217;s enough to make you think.

**Update**

[@technicalfault](http://twitter.com/#!/technicalfault/status/7015958828810240) just spotted I&#8217;ve got a &#8220;Top Tweet&#8221;. Awesome.
