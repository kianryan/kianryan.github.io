Shortly after the write-up for the [Psion Series 5](/2021-07-14-psion-5mx/), I picked up a [Psion 3a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3#Psion_Series_3a) from 
a fellow collector through a retro group.  The plan was to do a write-up 
comparing the two platforms.  Despite that you can see the DNA carry from the 3 
to the 5, they're distinct platforms with their own 
characteristics, and both are worth exploring.  There's software available for the 
3 series that was never released for the 5.

I stopped writing that post and started writing this post after playing with the 
built in language - OPL. Psion 
has shipped a version of OPL either built in or via an expansion pack since the 
original [Organiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Organiser) allowing you 
to write software on device.  The Psion 3 ships with version 3 of OPL, which 
I believe is a great blend of expressiveness and power, without some of the 
complexity introduced with the later versions.

Psion considered OPL so important to the Psion that it's right there on the 
home page.  It's BASIC-like, but not entirely BASIC compatibile.  Anyone with 
experience programming home computers from the 1980s can pick this up quickly, 
using the [Psion programming reference](https://www.si.unix-ag.org/docs/psionopl/) as a guide.

Programming on device is a great experience - the editor is one of the best of 
worked with for the period, on desktop or mobile.  But typing long programs on 
a tiny keyboard is fatiguing over time. Psion released a PC emulator for OPL development -
[S3AEMUL.EXE](http://www.primrosebank.net/computers/pda/psion3a/psion3a_software_emulators.htm). 
This was designed for MS-DOS, and works well in [Dosbox](https://www.dosbox.com/).  It gives 
you a local development drive for file storage, and these files can be transferred 
to your real device using either [PsiWin or RCom](https://winworldpc.com/product/psiwin/2x). 
I've had problems with PsiWin, but RCom has been very reliable with Dosbox, a RS232 USB cable and a soap on a roap.

So given all this, what can we build?  Psion gave real power to their OPL 
language - with standard language functions, access to the inbuilt database, 
GUI functions and more.  This gives a very quick system to rapidly powerful GUI 
applications.

I started with typical hello world applications, but quickly moved on to building 
a D&D character generator.  [This is just a playground 
application, but the source code is here for you to examine 
and run and your own device.](https://github.com/kianryan/psion3opl)  You can create a party of members, add new members 
to that party, and set statistics using dice rolls.  Is it particularly useful? 
Probably not, but I was able to build it over two evenings and it uses 
several of the in built library functions for data and graphics and has some polish. 
It was _easy_ to build using the documentation and the emulator.

Which can't be said about my current mobile.  My mobile is a great device to 
consume content on, but it has no built in tools to extend it's functionality. 
If I want to build an application for it, I have to use another computer to 
download a build environment, build the application, sign it, and then transfer 
the packaged app to my phone.  On the Psion, all the tools are right there, on 
my home screen.  It does feel like we're missing an opportunity here.
