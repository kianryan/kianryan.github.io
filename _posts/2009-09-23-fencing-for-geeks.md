Since a few people have been asking recently… I am currently coaching at two clubs in the North-West: Manchester and Altrincham. Beginner geeks are welcome to turn up to either, and will be welcomed by a smile and a circuit board.

[Manchester – Manchester Fencing Club](http://www.manchesterfencingclub.org.uk/)
  
This club caters for all fencers from beginners to international.
  
I’m here every other week (other coaches are availible at other times). Ping for details.

Thursday 1900-2130

[Altrincham – Salle Kiss](http://agsb.co.uk/) This club is a new club, currently catering to beginners. A good environment for beginners to feel comfortable.

Wednesday 1900-2100

Fees vary from club to club. For your first session, stick a tenner in your pocket and you’ll get plenty of change (I don’t handle money and can rarely remember what fees are from one week to the next).

# I’m horribly unfit!

Isn’t that the point? Seriously, we cater for all shapes, sizes and fitness. Turn up and give it a try. The sport is fun, addictive, painless (mostly) and we provide all the kit you need. Just bring yourself, a pair of trainers or squash shoes, tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt. You’ll want some water and a towel as well.

To make it a bit more fun (and to leave out those first week blues), why not organise a couple of you to turn up together?

Oh, and you’ll get to hit me in a large leather jacket repeatedly. What could be more fun?

# Interested?

Drop me a quick e-mail or comment to let me know you’re coming. It’s also useful to know how big you are (chest size and height) so I know if I need to grab some larger jackets from elsewhere.

# But I’m a Foreigner!

Not a problem – there are plenty of clubs out there. Have a look at the British Fencing [Club directory](http://www.britishfencing.com/British_Fencing.asp?PageID=39), and contact the club secretary (using that old-tech thing called a phone). That’s why they’re listed.
