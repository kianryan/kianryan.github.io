I've been using the RC2014 as a a CP/M development machine, especially while 
developing a cross-platform Rogue-like game.  I love it.  And whilst it's a hell 
of a lot more portable than carrying a Osborne 1 or a Amstrad CPC 6128, it's 
not something I can keep in the laptop bag and just pull out at the coffee shop 
(Both the [RC2014 Mini](https://z80kits.com/shop/rc2014-mini/) with [CP/M upgrade](https://z80kits.com/shop/rc2014-mini-cp-m-upgrade-kit/) *and* the [Extreme Kits RC2040](https://extkits.co.uk/product/rc2040/) are ideally suited for this).

I wanted to see if I could put together a truly tiny CPM based system using RunCPM 
and the [RunCPM-Pi-Pico](https://github.com/guidol70/RunCPM_RPi_Pico) project and 
make it *even smaller*.

Using a [Pimoroni Tiny 2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/tiny-2040?variant=39560012234835), 
and an [Adafruit 3V Micro SD SPI breakout](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-micro-sd-spi-or-sdio-card-breakout-board-3v-only?variant=32107008131155), 
I wired them both to a piece of leftover protoboard, using the wire to stand the Tiny 
off the board (the Tiny has components on both sides).

I pulled the code down from the repo, [added a new hardware profile in](https://github.com/kianryan/RunCPM_RPi_Pico/blob/tiny2040/GL20221026_Source_RunCPM_v6_0_RPi_Pico.zip/RunCPM_v6_0_Pico_26102022/hardware/pico/tiny_sd_rc2040_spi.h), and followed 
the instructions for using the adding [2040 board support to Arduino](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico). [I've branched the code here, which also contains the pin mappings for this configuration](https://github.com/kianryan/RunCPM_RPi_Pico/blob/tiny2040/GL20221026_Source_RunCPM_v6_0_RPi_Pico.zip/RunCPM_v6_0_Pico_26102022/hardware/pico/tiny_sd_rc2040_spi.h).

![Zork, running on TinyCPM](/assets/images/2022/11/14/zork.png)

First test is Zork, which is running fine.  I'll do some more comprehensive testing 
later hopefully involving Turbo Pascal - but this might be the smallest CPM machine built so far?


>  __Edit:__ - So Extreme Electronics pointed out that the prototype for the RC2040 started off in pretty much the same way, and [he has a tiny version that's even smaller](https://www.extremeelectronics.co.uk/emulating-a-z80-rc2014-with-cpm-and-ide-drives-via-an-sd-card/), using a Tiny2040 and a SD Card Adapter.  This is the current winner for smallest CP/M machine.
