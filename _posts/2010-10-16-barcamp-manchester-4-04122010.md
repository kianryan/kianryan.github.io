Hey folks,

just an update to let you know that Barcamp Manchester 4 is happening. We&#8217;re running it on the 4th of December at [Madlab](http://madlab.org.uk/). There&#8217;s an &#8220;official&#8221; announce over on the [geekup mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/geekup/browse_thread/thread/c96af1fe3430d5c2). There&#8217;s a high likelihood that we&#8217;ll be running the [Geekup Christmas social](http://www.flickr.com/photos/simplified/3108348795/in/photostream/) on the evening, which will be ticketed seperately.

We&#8217;ll be likely launching the tickets on the weekend of October 30th, which is when more than one person is in the right part of the right country at appropriately the right time.
