In this increasing age of digital, you would be forgiven for thinking that analogue photography was going the way of the dodo. Not so, in fact it&#8217;s benefiting from something or a resurgence over recent years.

But having been in this position myself a few years ago, I appreciate that knowing where to start to acquire darkroom and film bodies is not necessarily the most straightforward of things. Google searching provides a limited list, and you don&#8217;t know if you can trust the dealers of not.

So here I present my list of shops. These are the ones I have either purchased from, or have heard enough to consider well enough to shop from. There are various shops dealing with chemicals, paper, darkroom equipment and film cameras, with reasonable prices for the aspiring amateur in mind.

I hope it proves of some use to you.
