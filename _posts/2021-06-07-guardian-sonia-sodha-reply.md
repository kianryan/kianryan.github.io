I wrote to the Guardian letters desk, based on a number of messages I 
received today.  It's the first time I've felt compelled to do so.  I fully 
expect the letter to disappear in to the ether, so I'm also publishing it 
here.

This is a reply to this [opinion piece in the Guardian](https://www.dumptheguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/06/stonewall-risks-all-it-has-fought-for-in-accusing-those-who-disagree-with-it-of-hate-speech).

Sonia Sodha argues that winning the argument involves building
solidarity via compromise.  Compromise involves both sides being able
to make concessions to achieve a common goal.  Sonia suffers from the
same position I've seen from many commentators recently, which only
view's this debate from a very extreme viewpoint under the guise of
moderation.  Trans people wish to live equally and fairly on their own
terms, nothing more.  I've had messages today from upset friends
calling this a war on their existence.  The comparison to anti-semitism
may look extreme, but when you're scared for your life and your
future, how else do you see it?

You can only compromise if you have something to compromise with.  In
the mid 1980s the media debate about homosexuality was as fervent as
today's media discussion on transsexuality, and led to the introduction
of Section 28.  Section 28 was another compromise; to quote Jill
Knight, "The major point of it was to protect children in schools from
having homosexuality thrust upon them."  The media created a frenzy,
conservative politicians capitalised on it, and one of the most
regressive pieces of modern legislation was introduced in this country
and stayed on the statute books from 1988-2003 (England and Wales).
Being part of the primary and secondary education system during this
period, I and others around me were closeted, frustrated, sometimes
abused, had almost no access to support, didn't understand themselves,
and were often led to believe they were monsters on society.  For me,
it took until beyond university to undo most of the damage done by the
years of oppressive schooling.

We are running dangerously close to history repeating itself.  As
reported Liz Truss, the equalities minister is encouraging departments
to quit Stonewall's Diversity Champions program, the UK government has
rolled back plans on self ID in contradiction of the report from the
Women and Equalities Committee on the GRA, and the LGBT advisory panel
has disbanded after three advisors quit accusing the government
department of "vilifying trans people".  Combined with columns hosted
in the media such as the above, which do not help to further any
discussion, merely (ironically given the hero image) oppress and
silence, we're rapidly sliding right back into the crux of 1988.

If you're in the trenches, taking fire day after day, it really does
look like a war.
