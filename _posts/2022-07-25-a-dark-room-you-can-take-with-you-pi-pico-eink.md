We're big fans of [John Robertson's The Dark Room](https://www.thejohnrobertson.com/thedarkroom/).  For those not familiar, here's the trailer.

The dark room is a live stage comedy show where members of the audience are invited to play 
an on-screen adventure game with multiple options.  If they succeed, they win money.  If 
they don't, they die.  Over lockdown, [John took the show online and started presenting on 
Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/robbotron).  People follow along chanting the words, wear shirts, and draw art.  It looks 
suspiciously *not* like a cult ðŸ‘€. [There's also a computer game if you need a home dose of sadism](https://store.steampowered.com/app/918530/The_Dark_Room/).

At a Manchester gig last year, one of the online moderators, invited us to 
wear "Hello, my name is" badges so we could work out who we all were, beyond Darren.  It was
a good gig, many death, much flamboyant potato.

Back at home, I had acquired a [Waveshare Red/Black E-Ink screen](https://www.waveshare.com/product/pico-epaper-2.9-b.htm) to use with a [Raspberry Pi 
Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/), and had some vague ideas of turning it into a conference name badge (great minds think alike - this was before [Pimoroni released the Badger](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/badger-2040?variant=39752959885395)).  The dark room 
game is straightforward - four options per screen.  Four buttons.  We can build that.

# Building the hardware

The Waveshare EInk screen is a 2.9" EInk screen with board and headers to interface 
with a Raspberry Pi Pico over SPI.  If we mate a Pico board in this configuration, then it 
will stand at over an inch tall before we add any other components, and that's a bit too chunky to carry. 
I tried to source some appropriate low level headers, but in the end I ended up removing the headers and 
soldering the two boards directly to each other, reducing the height by half.

I want this to be a fully self contained little badge, that people can pick up and play with. 
I added a [2000mAh flat LiPo battery](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/lipo-battery-pack?variant=20429082183) and a [LiPo shim from Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-lipo-shim?variant=32369543086163).  The shim can handle power 
and charging.  Because it needs to sit on the underside of the Pico, I removed the JST header 
and attached wires to allow the board to sit flusher.  Some kapton tape before soldering 
avoids accidental contact.

Big 12mm tact buttons provide the directions.  Two small 6mm tacts provide power and reset.

Finally, a micro usb extension cable was carefully pulled apart from remove as much housing as 
possible to allow the micro port to be redirected to the bottom edge of the case.

Once we've done all that, we just have to stuff it in to a case.

# Designing a flamboyant case

I've switched over to using [FreeCAD Link Daily](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases) for most of my 3D printing CAD. 
I'm finding pain points every so often while designing a project, but I'm still happy enough with this.

This project is pretty straight-forward: design a box, add some cut outs, and add a snazzy 
in laid design to the front from an SVG.

I think the front design nearly killed me.  Importing the SVG once was fine, but FreeCAD 
makes little use of hardware acceleration, and it struggled with taking the outline of a 
flamboyant potato (pineapple), repeating it 5x9, and then both padding and cutting it.  And 
once you had done it once, the *only* way to make changes to the underlying structure was to 
delete it, make your changes and then reapply it - or else the entire application would 
crash out.

This required a fair amount of patience.  And tea.

![Case Design in FreeCAD](/assets/images/2022/07/25/case-design.png)

Project was sliced in [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) and then printed on a 
[Prusa Mini](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mini-semi-assembled-3d-printer-4/).  Inlay layers printed in 
[PolyTerra PLA Cotton White](https://shop.3dfilaprint.com/polyterra-pla-cotton-white-175mm-1kg-23836-p.asp), and then print the model using [PolyTerra PLA Savannah Yellow](https://shop.3dfilaprint.com/polyterra-pla-savannah-yellow-175mm-1kg-23898-p.asp).  I 
love the texture of this PLA, and have been using it *a lot* for project housings.  It *feels* 
fantastic.

Four heat set corner nuts in M3 in the case are matched by 12mm M3 hex button nuts to close the 
back.

To finish the theme, I found a flamboyant lanyard.

# Writing a Dark Room

I've built the software in [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/), it's given me a nice quick build cycle.  Since I'm 
currently using a Windows box, WSL1 and tmux gives me a nice split for jobs - Vim for editing, 
minicom for serial and a [make script I can run that uses pyboard.py to push the files to the badge](https://gist.github.com/kianryan/37fd8ae5db3be752b995479b463b5a3c). 
It's a nice feedback loop.

I'll add my usual disclaimer that I'm my python is a bit fudgy at best.  All code is provided 
for your own amusement.

I would usually share *all* of the source code for a project.  However, this project contains 
information on game script that is not my property, and as such is not mine to share.
I'll share my approach to architecture, and tools I've used along the way.

The software is split in to three key scripts:
* __main.py__ - A loop that switches between attract modes
* __name_badge.py__ - An attract mode that displays a three colour name badge.
* __game.py__ - The main game.

Keeping this separation makes debugging simple.  If I need to focus on the game, I tell main.py 
to load the game directly, and we don't worry about the attract mode and vice-versa.  If I plan 
to add another module, I can just add the functionality in to main.

```
# Define main handler for passing between application functions.

from name_badge import main as name_main
from game import main as game_main

while True:
    name_main()
    game_main()
```

The attract mode displays a name badge.  Press a button exits the method and starts the game method:

```
def main():
    init_gamescreen()
    write_name('DARREN')
    write_gamescreen(hello_border_buffer, draw_bg='red')

    while True:
      if (
        button_ne.value() == 0 or
           button_nw.value() == 0 or
           button_se.value() == 0 or
           button_sw.value() == 0):
           return;
```

![Darren](/assets/images/2022/07/25/darren.jpg)

The game uses a dictionary of rooms that's kept in rooms.py, and a variable indicating the current 
room.  Each room has a blurb and a set of exits, and looks like:

```
dark_room = {
  "home": Room(
      "You awake to find\n" +
      "yourself in a\n" +
      "dark room.",
      Exit("Why?", "why"),
      Exit("Go North", "mr_spike"),
      Exit("Find Light\nSwitch", "find_light_switch"),
      Exit("Sleep", "sleep_1")
  ),
  # ... lots more room entries
}
```

If we ask a room for a direction, we'll get an Exit, and a pointer to the next room:
```
current = dark_room['home']
next = current.ne
print(next.exit_id) # why
current = dark_room[next.exit_id] # set current to next room id
```

This being the dark room, we do have a special kind of room, the one you don't come back from.  
```
    "mr_spike": Die(
        "You go in the a direction\n" +
        "you believe to be North.\n" +
        "Straight in to MR SPIKE.",
    ),

```

We can then handle these as special exceptions in our game loop.

![Ya Die](/assets/images/2022/07/25/yadie.jpg)

Our game loop is then no more complicated than moving from room to room, asking the 
player what they want to do next, and handling that decision.  If the player dies, 
we exit this method, which returns us to our main and will bring us back to the attract 
mode.

```
def main():
    # Load dark room state
    i = "home"
    room = dark_room[i]

    while(isinstance(room, Room)):
        print(room.blurb)

        init_gamescreen('red')

        if room.blurb is not None:
            write_blurb(room.blurb)

        write_gamescreen(fb_room_blank, draw_bg=None)

        # Init room, draw state
        init_gamescreen('red')

        if room.ne is not None:
            write_lines(room.ne.label, Position.TOP_RIGHT)
        if room.nw is not None:
            write_lines(room.nw.label, Position.TOP_LEFT)
        if room.se is not None:
            write_lines(room.se.label, Position.BOTTOM_RIGHT)
        if room.sw is not None:
            write_lines(room.sw.label, Position.BOTTOM_LEFT)

        write_gamescreen(fb_room_blank, draw_bg='black')

        # Wait for input

        dir = None
        while dir is None or (getattr(room, dir) is None):
          if button_reset.value() == 0:
            return

          if button_ne.value() == 0:
            dir = 'ne'
          if button_nw.value() == 0:
            dir = 'nw'
          if button_se.value() == 0:
            dir = 'se'
          if button_sw.value() == 0:
            dir = 'sw'

        print(dir)

        next_id = getattr(room, dir).exit_id
        room = dark_room[next_id]

    if isinstance(room, Die):

        init_gamescreen('black')
        cut_dims = write_blurb(room.blurb + "\n\nYA DIE! YA DIE! YA DIE!", inverse=True)

        fb_red.fill_rect(cut_dims[0], cut_dims[1], cut_dims[2], cut_dims[3], white)

        write_gamescreen(fb_yadie, draw_bg='red')
```

[Waveshare provide an excellent wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-ePaper-2.9-B) which makes working with their EInk screens 
*easier*.  Not easy.  These 3 colour EInk screens perform full refreshes of both 
layers on each draw, which makes them incredibly slow, and a little painful when 
you're trying to debug issues.

This project uses both graphics and fonts, and makes extensive uses of framebuffers 
to put them together.  [font_to_py.py](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-font-to-py) handles the font conversion, which are then 
loaded as regular python files.  

Graphics conversion needs a little more work:
1.  generate a 1 bit bmp in inverse colour (white in, black off)
2.  use imagemagick to convert the bmp to pbm. ```convert file.bmp file.pbm```
3.  Use [convert_pbm.py](https://gist.github.com/kianryan/0749f300b97136dca116180a43b1b4e4) to generate a readable bytearray.

Put together, you've got an interactive dark room that run an attract mode in the form of a badge, 
and then on a button press, launches in to a game.  You can also power down the device at any point and 
it'll keep whatever is displayed on the screen, making it excellent for all day use.
