I&#8217;m &#8230; exhausted. I think that&#8217;s the right word. When one of these finally passes, it feels like I&#8217;ve been competing all day. Before the feeling passes, and I just go back to thinking they&#8217;re minor things, I&#8217;m going to write about it.

A migraine is usually caused by a trigger. I have two, stress and exercise, which is ironic considering what I do. They can be anything though &#8211; food, alcohol, sunlight, there is no set pattern. Observers often think that just a headache, and wonder why you don&#8217;t just carry on.

Migraines are as individual as a fingerprint. Some people will suffer and stay functional, others completely break down.

My migraines take a specific pattern:

  * They start with tension in the back of the neck.
  * Next pain will start somewhere in my head. Usually behind my forehead and at the base of the back of my head.
  * Light hurts, looking at screens more so.
  * I go dizzy.
  * Sometimes I have problems speaking.
  * Thinking becomes disjointed and difficult. Simple things become near impossible.

When one of these hits, there&#8217;s only one thing I want to do &#8211; make it go away. Any way possible. I usually need help, because I&#8217;m not always capable of helping myself. First up, two ibuprofen and two paracetamol go down my gullet. No idea if they help anymore, but they&#8217;re the starting point. Heat and cold is next. One or the other may help, either a hot water bottle or a pack of peas to the top of the head, forehead and neck. If one doesn&#8217;t help, sometimes the other does. Next is a dark room, and attempting to get to sleep. If I can get to sleep, and stay asleep, I can sleep through the pain. Sometimes it&#8217;s too painful. Sometimes, sitting still helps. Sometimes, constantly moving helps. I used to always jump in to a warm bath. That&#8217;s not always helpful though.

I will try most and all of the above, and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t. A migraine does eventually go away on it&#8217;s own, usually after several, several, hours, sometimes a day. And when it&#8217;s gone, I feel exhausted, like I&#8217;ve been training all day with no let up.

This is all reactive. That is, it&#8217;s all done once the migraine starts. And it comes with Dread (qualifies for a big D). I worry about when the next one will hit, because when it does, my day is gone. And that can mean cancelled classes, meetings, or even just planned down-time.

A few years ago, I discussed the problem with a friend. He gave me some Syndol, and this took the edge off the migraines. It didn&#8217;t make them go away, but it did take the edge off and made them liveable. Unfortunately, after a few months, the Syndol stopped working.

Last year, I approached my GP with the problem. I&#8217;ve suffered from these on and off since my mid teens, and I was hoping for some advise on dealing with them. The first response was to put me on beta-blockers. They killed all my energy, completely killed my ability to play any sport, and I really struggled to get work done. All I wanted to do was sleep. So, not happy with that, I nixed them and went back to dealing with them as and when they arose. To be fair to my GP, I didn&#8217;t go back for a second attempt, since I knew the next step was anti-depressants, and I wasn&#8217;t keen on that.

I have one known way of reducing the frequency of the triggers. Daily cardio helps, an hour of gym work, running or cycling a day helps. This is quite intensive, but means that I can participate in high-intensity sport without triggering a migraine. It doesn&#8217;t stop the stress triggered ones though. I can&#8217;t guarantee I can do this every day, and there&#8217;s a two week &#8220;bootstrap&#8221; where I&#8217;m guaranteed daily migraines. Once we&#8217;re past that point though, I&#8217;m ok.

Today I went for a jog. And it was a jog. 45 minutes, 6km. And felt pretty good when I got back. One shower later though and I went south with one of the worst migraines I&#8217;ve suffered for a long time. I tried everything listed above, and several hours later I was still in crippling pain. I found something I hadn&#8217;t tried before, sumatriptan in an over-the-counter form. Pricey, but I read good things and decided at this point to give it a shot. It worked, I have a second (they come in a pack of two), and it&#8217;s there for the next time one hits. No idea if they&#8217;ll continue working, of it this was a one time fluke. Nothings certain with migraines.

So why am I writing about migraines?

For starters because they&#8217;re misunderstood and crippling. They&#8217;re not a mild irritation, they can be complete life-changers. And because it&#8217;s useful to voice experiences for other people, hopefully there&#8217;s something useful in here for other suffers, or at least other sufferers can appreciate they&#8217;re not alone.

A resource I found recently which has proved immensely useful is \[http://www.migrainetrust.org/\](The Migraine Trust). Their fact-sheets are useful, and they provide strategies for coping, details on medications, and ways to work with the medical profession. It&#8217;s immensely useful. It&#8217;s the first dedicated resource I&#8217;ve found on migraines that puts everything in one place.
