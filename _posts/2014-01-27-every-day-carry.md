    I have a small confession, I've been bit of an [EDC (Every Day Carry)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyday_carry) obsessive for a number of months.
    
    I blame [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/).  After reading [his post on EDC](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/10/updating-your-utility-belt.html) , I recognised a bit of a kindred spirit.  As someone who works two very different jobs and spends a significant amount of time on client sites, what I carry on a day to day basis for work, work or pleasure tends to be quite important.
    
    EDC itself means different things to different people.  At its core, it's taking a long hard look at what you carry in your pockets and in your bags, and trying to be prepared for the range of things you're either likely, or mildly unlikely to encounter.  For some people (read Americans) this means packing two 9mm handguns, fifteen tactical knives and a [Burt's Bees](http://www.burtsbees.com/) chapstick[1].  For the rest of the world, this tends to approximate to having a cutting tool, a light, wallet, keys and mobile phone (see, that wasn't hard).
    
    Industry specific EDC becomes interesting, and pocket dumps on the EDC sub-reddit are at their best when someone comes along from a walk of life you wouldn't normally encounter.  It's interesting to see what tools a person needs to handle their day to day life.  Curious as to what a [magician carries](http://imgur.com/BOoNgzA)?
    
    For a lot of people, they're already carrying a lot of this stuff.  EDC is nothing revolutionary, nothing new.  People carry stuff in their pockets all the time - that's what they're there for.  But it is a good idea to occasionally have a think about what you're carrying.
    
    Personal Carry
    ==============
    
    _"What have I got in my pocket?"_
    This is not a guide.  This is simply a dump of what I keep in my pockets.  Note - no One Ring in here.
    
    On me whenever I'm wearing trousers of all descriptions.
    
    Front-left pocket:
    
    * [Leatherman Squirt PS4](http://www.leatherman.co.uk/product/Squirt_PS4).
    * [Fenix E05](http://www.fenixlight.com/ProductMore.aspx?id=44&tid=11&cid=1) wrapped in four foot of glow in the dark paracord.
    * 32GB [Corsair Flash Voyager Mini USB 3](http://www.corsair.com/en/flash-voyager-mini-32gb-usb-3-0-flash-drive.html), with tools and data.
    * House Keys with marine D shackle.
    * Car Key.
    
    Front-right pocket:
    
    * [Elephant Wallet E8](http://www.elephantwallet.com/e8wallet.html) (customized with an additional wrap of elastic).
    * [Moleskine Volant Notebook](http://www.moleskine.com/gb/collections/model/product/volant-extra-small-ruled-black) (Really wish this was available in gridded paper).
    * [Zebra SL-F1 Mini Expandz Pen](http://www.cultpens.com/acatalog/Zebra_Mini_Expandz.html) (Linked to Cult Pens since Zebra's site is /terrible/).
    
    Floating: Sometimes a back pocket, sometimes in my front right with wallet:
    
    * Samsung Galaxy S3 with OEM flip case.
    
    This little collection of things is surprisingly useful, and importantly, are in reach at all times, rather than having to constantly hunt for a tool I need.  I was unsure when I first got it just how often a flashlight would be used.  Simple answer - lots.  Yes, a phone can double as a torch, but it's one of the quickest ways of eating the battery and is useless when the battery is dead.  And the power output of modern LED flashlights is somewhat eyewatering for the capacity.
    
    The multi-tool is used a surprising amount, for a surprising number of applications.  The scissors and knife are used daily, screwdrivers slightly less so (although I did have to do an on-piste bodywire adjustment at the weekend).  The Leatherman Squirt gives me the advantage of pliers at the penalty of a little bit of weight.  If all you need is a blade, a swiss army knife is a damn fine alternative.
    
    The flash drive contains a set of [portable Windows tools](http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities) that allow me to use someone else's machine to do either development or support at a drop of a hat.  It's not as nice as my own machine, but if I'm out and I need access, I'm not stuck.  There's also [portable Vim](http://portableapps.com/apps/development/gvim_portable) and a current set of my vim config files, because I'll be damned if I'm ever without Vim.
    
    Wallets have changed quite a bit over the past few years.  [Minimal wallets](http://www.minimalwallet.net/) are the current trend, slim things that hold a few cards, measure a few millimetres and fit in to your front pocket.  The [elephant wallet](http://www.elephantwallet.com/) is a simple wrap of elastic, with space for cards and coins.  Most minimal wallets don't accommodate coins, which works in the US, but less so over here where a pound is still a useful unit of currency.  This gives the best of both worlds.  I like carrying a small notebook - either for lists, random notes, telephone numbers - there's a reason why paper is not yet completely dead, unlike my phone battery.  The little Zebtra Expandz pen extends up to the length of a regular pen, and is pretty comfortable for notes or extended writing.  It takes [D1 inserts](http://www.cultpens.com/acatalog/D1-Multipen-Refills.html) so you can take your pick from quite a range.
    
    I much prefer having bundles of things vs lots of loose things.  As such, there's a [S-biner](http://www.niteize.com/collection/S-Biner.asp) to hold my tools and keys together, and Cat added an additional wrap of elastic around my wallet to hold the notebook and pen.  This reduces the likelihood of leaving any one part behind.  Wake up - grab keys, grab wallet, grab phone, add glasses - done.
    
    Ready to face the day.
    
    Trousers - don't forget trousers.
