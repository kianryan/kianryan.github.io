A few bits of kit have been tested, a few still to test.

### Osprey Talon 33 Backpack

Someone lied when they designed this. It’s supposed to be a 33 litre sack. Under no circumstances is this 33 litres, it feels about the same load size as my old Karrimor Trail 45. Frameless design, airscape style back, light at 0.85kg, amazingly comfortable. Top loading with floating lid. Packed for a short test walk with a burrito style karrimat and bivvy kit. Hardly noticed it. Waist belt pockets are well designed and easily hold a S5. Carried for two hours in a thunderstorm, very happy.

### Alpkit Carbon Fibre Walking Poles

I like Alpkit. Possibly might be developing a bit of an Alpkit addiction. I’ve been using a borrowed pair of Black Diamond Contour poles for the past few day hikes, and they’ve made a huge difference to my pace and stability. Bought these for weight and based on reviews. 3 section design, twist locks, foam handles. Used for the first time on Irvington for a few hours in a thunderstorm. Foam does not absorb water, very light, very rigid. Being CF, would not recommend to novices due to break risk, but I’m really happy with them.

### Petzel E-Lite Headtorch

Had this since Christmas, and is primarily used as my night running light. Very light, elastic/drawstring fitting. Really happy as a running light, couldn’t find the bugger in my pack when I went hunting for it. Need better plan. Light is superb, but so small may get lost.

Arrived but not yet tested:
Alpkit Rig 3.5, Alpkit Hunka.
