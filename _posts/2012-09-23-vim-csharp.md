Vim&#8217;s built in CSharp/.NET support is a little thin on the ground, so I&#8217;ve been writing a plugin to make C# development easier. It&#8217;s available on [GitHub](http://github.com/OrangeT/vim-csharp), and feel free to fork and extend it yourself. At the moment it currently supports:

  * Enhanced syntax highlighting for C#.
  * MSBuild Support for .sln and custom build files.
  * Reporting compiler errors in QuickFix window.

Simple start, but it&#8217;s currently functional and I&#8217;m using it with my own projects.

Enjoy,
