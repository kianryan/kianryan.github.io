Now my new larger easel has finally arrived, I can announce one of my new projects. &#8220;Northern Geeks&#8221; will be a series of portraits of geeks in the north, showing them in their natural habitat and &#8220;at play&#8221;. I want to show geeks are people too.

The final images will be put into an exhibition, put online and be made available as a book.

So I need volunteers. If you would like to be part of this project, please send an e-mail to [&#x6b;&#105;&#97;&#x6e;&#64;&#107;&#x69;&#x61;&#110;r&#x79;&#97;&#110;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;.&#x75;&#107;](&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x6b;&#105;&#97;&#x6e;&#64;&#107;&#x69;&#x61;&#110;r&#x79;&#97;&#110;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;.&#x75;&#107;) with the subject &#8220;Northern Geeks&#8221; or comment on this post. Please enclose a small &#8220;geek bio&#8221;, and what you do for kicks (this can be something tech related or completely different). Sport, gaming, gardening, gerbil farming, anything. I&#8217;m looking to shoot and print in July with an aim to exhibition in August/September. If your natural habitat is a company office, please ensure you can gain permission to be photographed there before applying. All volunteers will be given a copy of the book as thanks.

Go on &#8211; be a part of something special.
