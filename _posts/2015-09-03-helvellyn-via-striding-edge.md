I wanted something I could get to (and get away from) by public transport, and ideally something linear, rather than circular. The first section of Offa&#8217;s [&hellip;]</span>

Back in 2014 I purchased a Chromecast, and it&#8217;s been nearly permanently connected to my TV ever since. Which is more than I can say for the Amazon Fire Stick. It&#8217;s simple, it works. Open app on phone, press icon, pictures and sound appear [&hellip;]</span>

Major events are televised (or streamed), results are instantly published online and in some cases, competitor information is displayed on the piste as the fencers compete. Fencers and referees are notified of where and when they need to be by remote screens linked to remote monitors. Not all events [&hellip;]</span>

You can see the quality of the output here. To do this, we used Raspberry Pis with the camera module and &#8220;official&#8221; case. We stuck them to the wall with gaffer tape and positioned the camera module with [&hellip;]</span>

At no point did he say, &#8220;oh, and let&#8217;s do a dozen other summits at the same time&#8221;. Bloody hell. Let&#8217;s rewind a bit.
