The previous power supply I used with the Sparkfun ATX bench-top converter resulted in magic smoke and a near fire.

So rather than use another old, potentially dodgy unit, grabbed a new cheap one from Scan, opened it up and removed anything that wasnâ€™t the ATX connector. Then shortened the ATX cable down to a few inches with some splicing and heatshrink. Finally superglued the Sparkfun unit to the surface.

Much better than before. And once finished, a much tidier assembly than before.
