<img alt="" src="http://www.americansoda.co.uk/img/logo_ontop.jpg" class="alignright"   />I’ve been in discussions with one of my fine clients [American Soda](http://www.americansoda.co.uk/) securing a discount for our the needs of fellow geeks. They’re also hoping to sponsor some community events in the future, so if you’re running a BarCamp, local user group or some such give us a [ping](mailto:kian@kianryan.co.uk).

For the moment though, American Soda is offering a 10% discount for the next seven days on presentation of the code **GEEK** at checkout. The more people that take up _this_ offer, the higher the likelihood they’ll run more offers in the future with potentially greater discounts. As a sample of their fine produce:

  1. [Mountain Dew](http://www.americansoda.co.uk/uk/American-Soda/Home/Mountain-Dew.aspx)
  2. [Mountain Dew](http://www.americansoda.co.uk/uk/American-Soda/Home/Mountain-Dew.aspx) (because yes – it needs mentioning twice)
  3. [Tab Cola](http://www.americansoda.co.uk/uk/American-Soda/Home/Drinks/Diet-Soda/Tab-Cola.aspx)
  4. [Paddy O’Brien’s Lucky Charms](http://www.americansoda.co.uk/uk/American-Soda/Home/Lucky-Charms.aspx)
  5. [Teddy Grahams](http://www.americansoda.co.uk/uk/American-Soda/Home/Groceries/US-groceries/Teddy-Grahams---Cinnamon.aspx)
  6. [Hershey’s Cookie and Cream](http://www.americansoda.co.uk/uk/American-Soda/Home/Candy/Chocolate/Hershey-Cookies-n-Cream-bar.aspx) (which I’m told are better than Oreos)]

And just because I can: <img src="/assets/images/2009/03/28w3v-0e3fb3146a08ef72ffeea4610e8e04b849c3c5eb-225x300.jpg" alt="Mountain Dew" title="Mountain Dew"   class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-171" srcset="/assets/images/2009/03/28w3v-0e3fb3146a08ef72ffeea4610e8e04b849c3c5eb-225x300.jpg 225w, /assets/images/2009/03/28w3v-0e3fb3146a08ef72ffeea4610e8e04b849c3c5eb.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />
