The [“At This Space”](http://www.atthisspace.co.uk) exhibition is opening on the 26th April, at 5pm. I’m invited to the private viewing and you’re not, so neerrrr. If you want to try and bribe your way in (there’ll be free drinks, and people, and cheese[1]), then drop [Cat Ashton](mailto:cat@catashton.co.uk) a line and she’ll try and weasel you in. [Cat’s work](http://www.catashton.co.uk) is being exhibited there as part of the exhibition.

Otherwise please, please, **please** drop by Tuesday to Saturday, 10am til 6pm. These are young, upcoming, budding artists who need all the support they can get. Hell, one of them may even be the next Henri Cartier-Bresson or Richard Avedon. The exhibition is being held at the rather fancy-pants Urban Splash location in Castlefield:

Urban Splash (Mooch)
  
Worsley Street
  
M15 4LD

I was there today helping put up some of the work, and occupying space at other times. The exhibition looks great, the space is superb and there’s some excellent work on the walls. All very much worth your time.
