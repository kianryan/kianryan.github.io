My partner, [Cat Ashton](http://www.catashton.co.uk) is doing the photography for the [Bolton Bazaar](http://www.boltonbazaar.co.uk/) this year. The bazaar is a celebration of the cultural mix of Bolton&#8217;s communities. You can see some of the photographs from the rehearsals on [this link](http://www.boltonbazaar.co.uk/2009_rehearsal_gallery.html).

There&#8217;s some coverage from the [Bolton News](http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/4523777.Final_polish_for_acts_before_Bazaar_show/) in the run up to the event and there&#8217;s a [Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJjectSHHg&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eyoutube%2Ecom%2Fuser%2FApnaonline&feature=player_embedded) of the 2007 (no idea why there isn&#8217;t one for 2008).

The event runs over two days (7th &#8211; 8th August 2009), with &#8220;Walk The Talk&#8221; on Friday (entertainment, food and debate) and the actual Bazaar on the Saturday. The Bazaar is held at the [Victoria Hall](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=victoria+halls+bolton&sll=53.578646,-2.442913&sspn=0.065228,0.11879&ie=UTF8&ll=53.580965,-2.430854&spn=0.007835,0.014849&z=16&iwloc=A), in Bolton starting at 1830 (arriving from 1815) It gains a little coverage from the local press, but that&#8217;s about as far as media attention goes.

We&#8217;ve got 9 tickets for the Friday event and 9 tickets for the Saturday event to give away. I&#8217;d like to see bloggers attend the event and help gain some extra publicity for it. The more publicity, the more likely community driven events like this will continue.

Bloggers may cringe at this bit, but there is a dress code &#8211; &#8220;smart&#8221;. I&#8217;m taking this to mean smart jeans, jacket and shoes, make of it what you will. I will be attending both evenings, and will happily meet people in the [MacDonalds around the corner](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=macdonalds+bolton&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=44.339735,60.820313&ie=UTF8&ll=53.578646,-2.442913&spn=0.065228,0.11879&z=13&iwloc=A) from the Victoria Hall before the event to abuse their Wifi at around 1800. Although I&#8217;d like to see people attending both days, the focus is on the Saturday event.

If you would like to attend, holler as a comment here or [reach me on twitter](http://twitter.com/kianryan).
