It’s a pre-requisite of almost all technical people – a good supply of coffee. I’ve noted in t’ North that our supply of high quality caffine has fallen off completely. Yes there are Neros, Starbucks and Costas, but these provide only mediocre caffine quality. Really high quality coffee can only be provided from small specialist coffee shops, who really do take care about the beam and the service.

While I’m in Brighton I’ve been visiting [Red Roaster](http://www.redroaster.co.uk/). A small coffee shop on St James Street, these people really understand how a coffee shop is supposed to, smell and taste. Their coffee alone is some of the best I’ve tasted, but their service comes with a smile and they support local artists (there’s a photography collection on the wall and they held an open-mic night last night).

Oh yes, and do try the ham and cheese croissant with mustard mayo. NOM.
