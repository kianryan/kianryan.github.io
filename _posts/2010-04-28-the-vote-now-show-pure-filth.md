![Clanger](/assets/images/2010/04/clanger.jpg) [The Vote Now Show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ry8mt) has been doing a sterling job of reporting on the events of the election campaigning for the past few weeks.

In return, they&#8217;ve only asked for one thing which has been denied of them &#8211; to be hated. So far, they&#8217;ve not received a single complaint. They&#8217;ve even gone so far as to shoot a clanger (artist&#8217;s rendering above) in an attempt to generate complaints.

So if you&#8217;ve been enjoying the broadcasts, please show your support for The Vote Now Show by [registering a complaint](https://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/forms/) with dear aunty.

For added humour, why not treat it as the traditional audience question? If you complain, leave your &#8220;complaint&#8221; in the comments section below. Mine is&#8230;

> Summary of Complaint: Shooting of Clanger &#8211; Contravention of Hunting Act 2004 Full Complaint: I had tuned in to the nightly Vote Now Show expecting pleasant and perfectly middle class humour. I was disgusted to hear the live shooting of a wild clanger, which had been outlawed since the passing of the Hunting Act 2004. The vile and insensitive performers of the show should be made to issue an immediate apology &#8211; as THIS white, middle-class worker is shocked and distressed. Yours, Kian Ryan
