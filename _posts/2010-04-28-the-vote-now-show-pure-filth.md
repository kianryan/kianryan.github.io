![Clanger](/assets/images/2010/04/clanger.jpg) [The Vote Now Show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ry8mt) has been doing a sterling job of reporting on the events of the election campaigning for the past few weeks.

In return, they’ve only asked for one thing which has been denied of them – to be hated. So far, they’ve not received a single complaint. They’ve even gone so far as to shoot a clanger (artist’s rendering above) in an attempt to generate complaints.

So if you’ve been enjoying the broadcasts, please show your support for The Vote Now Show by [registering a complaint](https://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/forms/) with dear aunty.

For added humour, why not treat it as the traditional audience question? If you complain, leave your “complaint” in the comments section below. Mine is…

> Summary of Complaint: Shooting of Clanger – Contravention of Hunting Act 2004 Full Complaint: I had tuned in to the nightly Vote Now Show expecting pleasant and perfectly middle class humour. I was disgusted to hear the live shooting of a wild clanger, which had been outlawed since the passing of the Hunting Act 2004. The vile and insensitive performers of the show should be made to issue an immediate apology – as THIS white, middle-class worker is shocked and distressed. Yours, Kian Ryan
