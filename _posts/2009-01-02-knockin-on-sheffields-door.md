I have to apologise for this. [Barcamp Sheffield](http://barcampsheffield.net/?p=350) launched a competition where entrants had to produce a piece of social media to promote digital media in Sheffield and/or Barcamp Sheffield.

[The Hodge](http://www.thehodge.co.uk/) produced a video entitled [&#8220;Sheffield People&#8221;](http://www.thehodge.co.uk/uncategorized/sheffield-people-thehodge-sings-omg.php), which reminded me I really should do mine. And so, I present my entry, &#8220;Knockin&#8217; on Sheffield&#8217;s Door&#8221;.



**Edit: Yes, I realise the competition has expired. Bah. Leaving it posted anyway**
