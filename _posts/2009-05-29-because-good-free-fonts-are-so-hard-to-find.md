Those who have to dip their toes into the life of a designer once every so often understand the importance of typography. One of the hard parts of typography is finding the right typeface that isn’t going to break your piggy bank (or your client’s piggy bank).

This morning [Tamara](http://troo.livejournal.com/197490.html) pointed me to [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com) . To quote from [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com)‘s website:

> ” We know how hard it is to find quality freeware that is licensed for commercial work. We’ve done the hard work, hand-selecting these typefaces and presenting them in an easy-to-use format.

It’s a simple directory of excellent, high quality, **free** fonts. Well done guys and keep up the good work.
