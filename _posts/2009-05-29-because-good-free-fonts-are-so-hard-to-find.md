Those who have to dip their toes into the life of a designer once every so often understand the importance of typography. One of the hard parts of typography is finding the right typeface that isn&#8217;t going to break your piggy bank (or your client&#8217;s piggy bank).

This morning [Tamara](http://troo.livejournal.com/197490.html) pointed me to [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com) . To quote from [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com)&#8216;s website:

> &#8221; We know how hard it is to find quality freeware that is licensed for commercial work. We&#8217;ve done the hard work, hand-selecting these typefaces and presenting them in an easy-to-use format.

It&#8217;s a simple directory of excellent, high quality, **free** fonts. Well done guys and keep up the good work.
