Welcome to the [LifeTrack](http://www.kianryan.co.uk/category/lifetrack), feel free to ignore it ð

This is a new category for the blog that’ll be dealing with me getting life, funnily enough, back on track. It’s going to be about food, gardening, exercise and most likely have little or nothing to do with [code](http://www.kianryan.co.uk/category/code/), [photography](http://www.kianryan.co.uk/category/photog/), [bob](http://www.kianryan.co.uk/category/comic/). Since graduating in 2003, I’ve wrestled with my work/life balance, usually falling far too far on the wrong side of work. This year I didn’t just decide that enough was enough, I decided to actually act on it. Also, in a world of economic recession, being sensible and looking after my primary business asset (me) as also in my best interests.

Over the course of the year, there’ll be updates to the state of the garden as we attempt to grow our own fruit and vegetables, possibly the occasional recipe and tips for attempting to keep your life in a roughly working order.
