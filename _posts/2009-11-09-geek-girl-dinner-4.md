We like [Geek Girl Dinners](http://girlgeekdinners.com/). Pleasant company, good food, good conversations. [Cat Ashton](www.catashton.co.uk) and I attended the [fourth geek girl dinner in Manchester](http://www.manchestergirlgeekdinners.co.uk/), this time being hosted at, [Sweet Mandarin](http://www.sweetmandarin.com/) (who also host regular tweetups). This time, we had the company of [Dom &#8220;The Hodge&#8221; Hodgson](http://www.thehodge.co.uk/) talking on [http://www.geekery.in/](Geekery.in) and community events, and [Liv Wild](http://www.linkedin.com/in/livwild) from [Thoughtworks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/), discussing productivity and happiness.

Good food. Good company. Awesome.

Also an awesome announcement that [BAE Systems](http://www.baesystems.com/) would be putting a large amount of cash behind the entire GGD movement. There&#8217;s also some mumblings of organising Girl Geek Teas, as a more frequent meet up with the same ideas of Geek Girl Dinners.

Here&#8217;s a few videos from the event. Apologies for the orientation &#8211; you would have thought that Youtube would give you an option to rotate them once they&#8217;re uploaded. Audio quality is a bit pants as well, taken on the phone. As is the video quality. In general, they&#8217;re a bit pants &#8211; but you can at least get a feel for how the evening went.
