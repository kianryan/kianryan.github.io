<img src="/assets/images/2011/12/forever_war_the.png" alt="" title="forever_war_the"   class="alignleft size-full wp-image-630" /></a> [SF Gateway](http://www.sfgateway.com/) (publishers of classic Sci-Fi), are holding a sale between Christmas and New Year, where all of their e-books are going for Â£2.99.

SF Gateway specialise in putting Ebooks out there for classic SF titles that will probably never see the light of a printing press again (they also have some classic well known SF listed as well). They’re well edited, and the books I’ve had through Kobo have been excellent.

Enjoy, and have a Merry Christmas.
