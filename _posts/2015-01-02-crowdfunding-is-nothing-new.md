    Whilst reading [Fire In The Valley](https://pragprog.com/book/fsfire/fire-in-the-valley)
    I came across the following, discussing how companies placed mail order adverts
    for products that did not as of yet exist:
    
    > Products were being announced before they were even designed, let alone built,
    > and the magazines supported the practice. Popular Electronics had passed off
    > an empty box as the original Altair and a mock-up as the Processor Technology
    > Sol in a couple of its cover stories. The journalistic excesses were probably
    > harmless, but ads used the same technique. Byte’s Carl Helmers said, “I’m not
    > saying [the technique was] legitimate, but it’s certainly one that’s used all
    > over the place in technology. A product may be there to show in so-called
    > functional simulation form, and that functional simulation is one step toward
    > making the thing actually happen.”
    
    In a sense, this was possibly one of the earliest forms of crowd-funding.  Adverts
    for computer components (and whole computers in some cases) were placed well in advance
    of production methods or resource being in place to build real units.  If enough units
    were sold, then the product was made.  If not, then the product failed.
    
    My father fell foul of one of these.  He bought a replacement keyboard for
    his ZX Spectrum from a mail order company.  The keyboard arrived but failed to
    work.  Before he could mail it back, the company went in to liquidation.
    
    This drew an odd parallel to a relatively modern concept - crowd-funding.  Adverts and
    pitches made that people buy in to on the promise of a delivered product.  Except that
    unlike these early practices, modern crowd-funding on the whole attempts to be
    transparent about the current state of a product at the time of a campaign.
