On Saturday I presented a short talk on building a basic android application in 20 minutes. This was the full process, from generating the shell project, to writing the code, generating the layouts, testing on the emulator, signing the application and uploading the binary. I wasn&#8217;t able to do this as &#8220;live&#8221; as I would have liked &#8211; I&#8217;ll perfect the routine in time for Barcamp Manchester, but the group did a good job of being a dummy audience.

For those interested the application is called &#8220;Barcamp Blackpool&#8221; (available on the [Marketplace](http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-orangetentacle-bcblackpool-zxmE.aspx)). It downloads the latest 20 tweets with the [bcblackpool hash tag](http://twitter.com/#search?q=bcblackpool) and displays them as a list. Clicking on an individual item will then launch a browser session showing the tweet on the twitter website. Basic but functional. The source code for the application is available on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/barcamp-android/).

If there are other things people would like to see in a 20 minute Android demo &#8211; please feel free to comment on this post and I&#8217;ll see what I can do for [Barcamp Manchester](http://bcman2.nwdc.org.uk/).
