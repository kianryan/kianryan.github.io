Back in January, I wrote about [Trucking Hell](http://www.kianryan.co.uk/2009/01/trucking-hell/), a entertaining book by “Bowen T Hunter” available through [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/content/5725432). It’s an entertaining book, if a little rough around the edges.

Mr Hunter went around the block trying to get the book published after his original intended publishers went into the big corporate heaven in the sky. After some frustration, he’s finally decided to [serialise the book](http://truckinghelltheseries.blogspot.com/) with chapters being uploaded on Tuesday and Friday. Add it to your RSS reader, and if you like what you read consider buying a copy.
