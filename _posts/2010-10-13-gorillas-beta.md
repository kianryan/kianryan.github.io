<p style="clear:both;">
  I ran a talk at Barcamp Manchester 3 on a small game I’ve been writing for Android. Gorillas is a well known formula for those of us who played around with MS-DOS 5 and QBasic. Two gorillas stand on atop “towers” and take turns to lob bananas at each other. Hitting the other player with a banana scores a point.

The game is open source, for which the code can be accessed here: <http://code.google.com/p/gorillas-android/>

It’s still very much pre-release status, but does support destructible landscapes and explosions.

If you’re on an Android device, you should be able to access the application by clicking on [this link](market://details?id=com.orangetentacle.gorillas).
