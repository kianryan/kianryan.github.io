Here we go Visual Studio 2010 & ASP.NET 4.0

  * Lots of content _not_ being covered. At least he&#8217;s clear about this.
  * Now built on WPF &#8211; woof. Multi monitor support.
  * Demos being done on the MVC codebase ðŸ™‚
  * Code navigation &#8211; select param, highlights all instance usages. 
  * Intellisense &#8211; Mid term search, no longer need to type start of term. Filters based on camelcasing _woot_. Someone has been using Quicksilver.
  * Oh dear &#8211; resharper is in trouble. Navigate to &#8211; &#8220;goto Type&#8221;. Although now quite as neat &#8211; needs keyboard interaction.
  * View call heirarchy &#8211; more Resharper features ðŸ™‚ (althought being able to keep searches around is a nice feature.
  * Col based code selection as well as line selection.
  * TDD support &#8211; &#8220;Consume First&#8221;, stops intellisense from attemting to autocomplete when writing not-yet-existing classes. Then becomes aware of class and allows you to define/work with properties. Nice.
  * TDD support &#8211; generate class (wait &#8211; this wasn&#8217;t in 08? More resharper?)
  * MY GODS &#8211; 2010 really is 2008 + Resharper (so far). Remind me to reiterate my love for Resharper.
  * CodeSnippets in VS2010 feel like completion in TextMate. Nice mechanism. Extended for ASP.NET, download extra snippets.
  * #scottgufact &#8211; Scott Gu works at Redmond, you don&#8217;t.
  * Debug history &#8211; useful landmarks in lifecycle. 
  * Historic debugging &#8211; allows step forward/step _back_ through source code.
  * Test tool &#8211; run on client, captures information on state of crash. Sends state back to developer. Developer can debug _from the state of the crash_. That&#8217;s pretty damn neat. Can also capture screenshots/video.
  * .NET 4.0, new version of CLR (guessing because of dynamics, etc).
  * Visual Studio 2010 filters intellisense and properties for target framework. Uses reference libraries.
  * ASP.NET 4 &#8211; emphasis on clean HTML and SEO (routing, user configurable ClientIDMode), etc.
  * Are we back on web apps vs web sites? (Scott jumped straight to web app rather than web site).
  * New web app template looks good. Jquery, logins, etc included out of the box. Very nice.
  * ClientIdMode &#8211; Predictable is the new black (and will save front end developers having migraines when given ASP.NET apps).
  * CSS rendering for controls &#8211; YES! THE TABLES ARE BANISHED! RenderTable=false
  * Finer grained control over the viewstate.
  * Improvements coming to the WYSIWIG designer &#8211; who uses the designer for ASP.NET? Really?
  * Routing support for ASP.NET 4 &#8211; quite elegant ðŸ™‚ Page.RouteData.Values. Doesn&#8217;t to URL rewriting, more subtle mechanism.
  * IIS SEO Toolkit. Analysis tool for SEO optimisation of sites. Target site does not need to be running on IIS. Can perform some optimisations to IIS sites &#8211; hence linked to IIS manager.
  * It looks like VS 2010 javascript support no longer sucks. A seriously robust engine. Involves intellisense which can keep track of quite impressive object definition at design time. Woot!
  * ASP.NET Ajax &#8211; new things for those people that use it (I&#8217;ve never got on with it). 
      * ADO.NET Entity Framework &#8211; more T4 support _good_. Model first and POCO to boot.
  * Apparently LINQ 2 SQL is not dead &#8211; improvements coming. I remain sceptical.
  * Design surface no longer has a &#8220;dump and replace&#8221; attitude. This may rendel DBML Tools redundant.
  * Inbuilt fake support, reliance on T4 &#8211; looks like MS is buying hard into T4 for code gen. I see this as a positive thing.
  * I admit &#8211; the chart control is cute ðŸ™‚
  * WAIT? Multiple config file support &#8211; build config dependant. I do this already! I will no longer be special! Don&#8217;t like deployment support from within VS, prefer to do it clean from a build server.
  * Release specific configs only contain overwrites &#8211; this is useful.
  * If you can tie the Deployment Projects up with build servers (I&#8217;m looking at you CCNet), you&#8217;ve got a rather powerful test & deployment environment.
  * Seriously folks &#8211; this is one of the really nice things&#8230;
