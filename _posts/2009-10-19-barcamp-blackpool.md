This weekend saw the first [Barcamp Blackpool](http://twitter.com/#search?q=bcblackpool), held at the Blackpool Pleasure Beach. Many thanks go to [@ruby_gem](http://twitter.com/ruby_gem) for organising the event, and to the various sponsors, including [Yahoo](http://developer.yahoo.com/) for sponsoring the all important bar and [Pixel Programming](http://www.pixelprogramming.com/) for ensuring we had a venue and noms. My apologies to to all those I may have caused hangovers to for the following day. We also managed to lose [Phil Winstanley](http://twitter.com/#search?q=plip%20%23bcblackpool) for a few hours.

Talks were wide ranging, from some light-hearted ones on upcoming social network [Pokebook](http://www.pokebook.co.uk/) through to code reviews of the new [W3C website](http://www.w3.org/) and my own talk on building and publishing an Android application in <strike>1 hour</strike> <strike>30 minutes</strike> 20 minutes (code to follow).

Evening entertainment was provided by [Paul Sylvester](http://www.paulsylvester.co.uk/), who provided the BEST MAGIC SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN (don&#8217;t let the website fool you). So much so, there&#8217;s speculation about hiring him for one of the next [Geek Girl Dinners](http://www.manchestergirlgeekdinners.co.uk/).
