This weekend saw the global [Coderetreat](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/) happen, where developers all around the world worked in regional groups to improve their coding techniques, and to try out new ideas/languages.

In Manchester, our sessions revolved around [Conway’s Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), a simple cellular automaton. Working in pairs, every 45 minutes we would throw away our work and start again in a new pair.

Nothing is more frustrating than spending a whole day writing code, and having nothing to show for it. So this evening I hacked out a javascript implementation of life, and a HTML/JS front end for it. Set a grid size, then click on the cells to set the initial state. Start and stop the game and alter the state at any time.

You can try it out [here](http://www.kianryan.co.uk/life/), and the code is available to do with as you please on [GitHub](https://github.com/kianryan/JSGameLife).
