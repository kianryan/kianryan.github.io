For most people that publish Android apps, the following happens:

  1. Write App
  2. Publish On Marketplace
  3. People Download
  
    &#8230; 
  4. Get _harrased_ by marketing e-mails promising you&#8217;ll make millions of pounds with in-app purchases.

In true form, the following landed in my inbox:

> Hi Orange Tentacle Ltd,
    
> My name is Quinn, Senior Account Manager at TapContext. I was playing around with one of your apps and liked it. I just wanted to reach out to hear about your current monetization strategy and to give you an idea of what we offer at TapContext: contextually targeted ads and payouts a bit higher (quite a bit higher) than other ad networks.
    
> 
    
> Our network CPM right now runs over $4, Interstitials in the USA over $8 CPM and sometimes close to $12 CPM, and developer earnings per download are on average over 3 cents!
> 
> We are always interested in finding new developers, with cool apps, to work with and help them generate the most amount of revenue as possible. I would like to jump on a phone call (my cell is 347.698.7156) or Skype call (my skype is quinn.mccullough) if you are available. Please let me know! If you don&#8217;t have time for a call, you can check out our website at: tapcontext.com Thanks,

&#8220;I was playing around with one of your apps.&#8221;, left me asking &#8220;really?&#8221;. So I called bullshit on Twitter:

[<img src="http://www.kianryan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Quinn-1-300x129.png" alt="Quinn-1" width="300" height="129" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-975" srcset="http://www.kianryan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Quinn-1-300x129.png 300w, http://www.kianryan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Quinn-1.png 335w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](https://twitter.com/kianryan/status/352098871813488640)

I wasn&#8217;t the only one to receive the e-mail either&#8230;

[<img src="http://www.kianryan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Quinn-2-264x300.png" alt="Quinn-2" width="264" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-977" srcset="http://www.kianryan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Quinn-2-264x300.png 264w, http://www.kianryan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Quinn-2.png 335w" sizes="(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px" />](https://twitter.com/_elj/status/352109514419486720)

So I was then surprised to actually get a tweet from Quinn himself:

[<img src="http://www.kianryan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Quinn-3-300x126.png" alt="Quinn-3" width="300" height="126" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-979" srcset="http://www.kianryan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Quinn-3-300x126.png 300w, http://www.kianryan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Quinn-3.png 333w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](https://twitter.com/TapContext/status/352144989494575104)

Fair enough. So I gave him my e-mail address, and honestly didn&#8217;t really expect to receive a response. Then the following arrives:

> Hi Kian,
    
> 
    
> I&#8217;m glad we were able to find you on twitter and touch base. You have a very interesting blog and twitter feed. It&#8217;s also good that we can clear the air &#8211; hoping to be downgraded from the Bollocks category &#8211; maybe Nancys, Wankers, or Cheeky would be more appropriate. ðŸ˜‰
    
> 
    
> The app that we played was your Gorillas app. My peer and I wasted several hours &#8211; don&#8217;t tell our funders &#8211; trying to hit each other in the face with bananas. (My peer is female). Unfortunately I lost every time &#8211; purposefully of course to make her happy. She still rejected my appeal to enjoy a few drinks Friday afternoon.
    
> 
    
> As for feedback on the app &#8211; I think it is well done. When developing classic games, there are not many deviations that are acceptable to maintain the classic&#8217;s integrity. You have done well &#8211; I commend you for that. The sun opening its mouth when a banana flies by &#8211; well done.
    
> 
    
> I&#8217;m looking forward to staying in touch. I won&#8217;t add any dull sales pitch of how we could generate more ad revenue for you in this email. ðŸ˜‰

That&#8217;s a reasonable e-mail. Quinn has taken the time to give a personal response, and done his research. Gorillas is an old game, and to be honest, is a bit of a nightmare on current hardware (heck, it has problems on high resolution screens).

To his due, he&#8217;s made a good effort, and it&#8217;s appreciated.

I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t downgrade him from &#8220;Bollocks&#8221; to either &#8220;Nancy&#8221;, &#8220;Wanker&#8221; or &#8220;Cheeky&#8221;. Where I&#8217;m from, those are mostly terms of endearment. However, I have downgraded him from &#8220;Bollocks&#8221; to &#8220;Marketing&#8221;, which is a small step down.

Well played Quinn, well played.
