![Finished Cross](/assets/images/2019/11/19/pectoral_cross.jpg)

I've done a number of soldering workshops for [Devoxx4Kids](http://www.devoxx4kids.org/) where we teach kids how to solder an [animal badge](https://thepihut.com/products/learn-to-solder-zoo-badge) with a rainbow LED, CR2032 and pin clip.  They're a great introduction and every child gets to take something away at the end of the session.  The little rainbow LEDs are fantastic - they don't need a resistor, and colour cycle through a number of colours.

This weekend, we have a murder mystery at our local pop culture cafe.  The theme is [Cluedo](https://www.cluedofan.com/).  I'm going as Reverend Green, Cat is going as Mrs Peacock.  We're working on costumes (I say we, Cat is busy in the cave putting together my waistcoat).  I wanted to throw together a small something.  A pectoral cross came to mind, a cross some clergy members wear around their neck.  And I wanted to incorporate a Cluedo figure in to the central structure.  So a few rough sketches later and I had crucified a Cluedo figure.  Fimo modelling clay felt right, and it's now available in [sparkly "effects" versions](https://www.staedtler.com/intl/en/products/fimo-modelling-clay-accessories/fimo-effect/).

And of course it needed some simple electronics.  Put together a CR2032 battery holder on the back, [4 rainbow LEDs](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/5mm-rainbow-led-pack-of-10) and some rat-nest wiring on the back and we're good to go.
