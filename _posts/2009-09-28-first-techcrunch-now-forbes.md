![Polanski](http://www.kianryan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/polanski.jpeg)

Apparently, hitting the &#8220;publish button&#8221; on articles that aren&#8217;t finished, or in some cases even started is all in vogue this year. First of all [techcrunch](http://www.kianryan.co.uk/2009/08/ooops-techcrunch-just-dropped-the-bomb-on-spinvox/) manage foot-in-mouth syndrome over Spingate, and now [Forbes has managed one](http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/09/27/movies-eu-switzerland-polanski_6935738.html), publishing an internal memo or note over the Polanski affair. Link available as long as it&#8217;s live.

This begs several questions:

  * Who is Frank?
  * Who are the sources in the Justice Department.
  * Does no one even _look_ for the draft button anymore?
