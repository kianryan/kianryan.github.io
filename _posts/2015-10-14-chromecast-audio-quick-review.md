    This may be one of the quickest reviews I've ever posted.
    
    Back in [2014](http://www.kianryan.co.uk/2014/04/24-hours-with-chromecast/) [I purchased](http://www.kianryan.co.uk/2014/04/72-hours-later-with-the-chromecast/) a Chromecast, and it's been nearly permanently connected to my TV ever since.  Which is more than I can say for the Amazon Fire Stick.  It's simple, it works.  Open app on phone, press icon, pictures and sound appear on your TV.
    
    Ever since it was released I've wanted to do the same for just audio.  We have speakers around the house that we plug phones in to for radio and music content.  I had considered a HDMI to 3.5mm adapter and another Chromecast unit, but just hadn't got around to it.
    
    Then Google announced [Chromecast Audio](http://www.google.com/chromecast/speakers/) and I had it pre-ordered before the announcement was over.
    
    It finally arrived.  Plugged it in, turned it on, used the Android Chromecast app to set it up.
    
    And that's it.  Dogcatcher, Plex and Google Music work out of the box, which is 96% of our sins.  [The BBC have stated that the radio app will support casting](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34391038), but there's no sign of that yet.  [I've asked for an update](https://twitter.com/kianryan/status/653542436472553472), but had no reply.  For now, starting the iPlayer Radio app and casting the phone audio works just as well.
    
    And it works.  Just as straightforward as the original Chromecast.  I can give no higher praise.
