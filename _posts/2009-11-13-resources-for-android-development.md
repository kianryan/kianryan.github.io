Just a short post today, outlining some cool stuff I&#8217;ve found for Android development.

# IntelliJ IDEA

Google have very kindly put together the ADT for Eclipse, which consists of plugins and layout managers to make development a bit smoother. Which would be great for me, if using Eclipse didn&#8217;t make me want to pull my nails out with forceps (I&#8217;m a Visual Studio person by day). I dislike Eclipse so much, that I spent most of the last project building in [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) and looking up API references by hand. The very nice people who make my most favourite Visual Studio plugin in the whole WORLD &#8211; [Resharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), also make a very nice Java IDE called [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Version 8 came with some basic plugins you could download for Android development, but the very nice people at Jetbrains have put some serious time into the Android tools for Version 9 of IntelliJ. Inbuilt Logcat support, and a run/deploy model which beats the socks off the Eclipse one. I believe there&#8217;s debugging support as well &#8211; I&#8217;ve not been able to test that yet though. All in all, a very nice environment. Oh, and most of the refactoring & code navigation tools that make Resharper so awesome in the first place. Check out [version 9 BETA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/index.html).

# DroidDraw Beta

[DroidDraw](http://www.droiddraw.org/) is a cross-browser UI designer and editor for Android applications. I&#8217;ve not had a proper play around with it yet, I&#8217;ve just been using it for a few days, but so far it is officially awesome. Much more reliable than the in built Eclipse editor, and nowhere near as frustrating. I&#8217;ll be honest, now I&#8217;ve got the very, _very_ good XML support which IntelliJ provides, I&#8217;m not needing it so much, but it makes a great prototyping tool.

Some articles which have been useful over the past few days:
  
[How to use AlertDialog.Builder in Android applications](http://www.maximyudin.com/2008/02/25/android/how-to-use-alertdialogbuilder-in-android-applications/) _Great quick reference to AlertDialog.Builder._
  
[What&#8217;s Your Preference: Part One](http://www.androidguys.com/2008/09/29/whats-your-preference-part-one/) _Writing preferences should be easy. _Don&#8217;t do my trick and write a load of custom layouts, only to realise the API does 90% of the work for you_
  
[What&#8217;s Your Preference: Part Two](http://www.androidguys.com/2008/10/07/whats-your-preference-part-two/) _more of the above_
  
[Android 1.5 android.R.drawable Icon Resources](http://www.darshancomputing.com/android/1.5-drawables.html) _The API contains a load of built in graphics you can just reference._
