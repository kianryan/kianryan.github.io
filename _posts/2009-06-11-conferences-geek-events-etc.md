I admit that I have been somewhat absent from community offerings for the past few months. The projects that I am currently working on have been a little hectic, with some appropriate last minute deadlines changes.

_But_

I’m hoping that July is going to be a free month. Completely free to do with as I please. As such, I am planning on taking it easy, pimping for some new work to start in August and catch up with those community events I managed to miss since Christmas.

So the question to you lot is – where would you like to see me over the next month. I can turn up and talk on a topic, or just turn up and be generally awesome. Tell me where you would like to see me over July, and I’ll try and book it in.

Oh and whilst were here, please take a look at [this post by The Hodge](http://www.thehodge.co.uk/random-musings/rants/richard-quick-design-bamboo-juice-fiasco.php). He could do with your support.
