Today we go and pick up a new ball of fluff &#8211; notably, this ball of fluff:

<a href="http://www.kianryan.co.uk/2012/05/name-the-kitten/kitten/" rel="attachment wp-att-744"><img src="/assets/images/2012/05/kitten.jpg" alt="" title="kitten" width="300" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-744" srcset="/assets/images/2012/05/kitten.jpg 600w, /assets/images/2012/05/kitten-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>

The ball of fluff is currently named &#8220;Fay&#8221;, which is probably not going to stick around here. Our other fuzzballs have been/are named:

  * Henery,
  * Seti,
  * Hathor,
  * Apollo,
  * Hannah,
  * Walnut,
  * Zaphod,
  * Chicken

For once, we&#8217;re a little stumped with this one. My usual suggestions of &#8220;Satan&#8221; and &#8220;Lucifer&#8221; have been rejected, so I&#8217;m throwing it open to you, my loyal readers. All suggestions are welcome, although we reserve the right to completely reject all your suggestions and come up with one of our own.
