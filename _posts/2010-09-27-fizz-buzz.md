I just read [“Why Can’t Programmer’s Program”](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html) over on Coding Horror. Out of sheer curiosity, I googled “Fizz Buzz C#” just to see what some people had engineered. The idea of the [“Fizz Buzz”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizz_buzz) test is to provide a starting point to prove you can write working code. Nothing complicated, but apparently 199/200 applicants can’t even do this.

I do hiring for a few of my clients, and I’m pretty much in agreement with the general community sentiments. I’ve had people across my desk quite a few times with what look to be quite distinctive backgrounds, only to fail at simple day-to-day ASP.NET coding tasks. I would recommend to _anyone_ involved in recruiting to make their candidates sit a simple skills test to determine whether they can actually code before putting applicants in front of a client. For discussion, I submit my own Fizz Buzz answer.

<div>
  <pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
using System;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        for (int i = 1; i < 101; i++) // i <= 100 is also fine
        {
            Console.WriteLine(FizzBuzz(i));
        }
    }
    
    public static string FizzBuzz(int i)
    {
        if (i % 15 == 0) return "FizzBuzz";
        if (i % 3 == 0) return "Fizz";
        if (i % 5 == 0) return "Buzz";
        return i.ToString();
    }
}
</pre>
</div>

That took 90 seconds to write, _and_ we can have a conversation about why I’ve factored FizzBuzz as a method (easy unit testing), why I’m using multiple exit points (because I think in this case it adds clarity) and why I’ve not made the amazingly trivial mistake (which around 50% of the google results did) of writing i < 100.
