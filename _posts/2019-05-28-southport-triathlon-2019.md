Southport serves as a bit of nexus.  It's early in the season, and yet acts as Triathlon England Standard distance championships, ETU qualifiers, and the BUCS Standard championships.  As such, it is a bloody fast race.  It's also it's been going for quite a while a while, [here's some Grandstand coverage from 1989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3McjxG5SJw&t=875s).

The swim is the biggest challenge of the course.  I was warned of the water quality - but not warned ... enough.  I don't think any warning would have been enough.  The swim course is two laps around an island in a closed lake.  It is foul from fowl.  I have never swam in water so awful.  It took a few minutes of retching before I could get going, and then settle in to a pace.  That was a first.  2:20-ish/100m, end up coming out at the back of the group.

Out of the water, on to the bike.  T1 was fine.  The bike course is straight, mostly flat with a little undulation and a bit of cross wind.  Head down, power up.  Happy to keep 31kph for most of the course, and play catch-up by around 50 places.

T2 proved fun.  I really needed a loo break, and had some issues getting out of my skinsuit.  I may have ended up with the longest T2 I've ever recorded.  Need a little more practice getting in and out of that thing.  On to the run, the run course is quite flat - and enjoyable.  Run courses can be boring as hell - just running around a field.  This one took in lakes, a bit of town, a model village, things to read.  Fantastic.  5:15/km for the first eight km, Down to 5:05/km and 4:40/km to finish.  Very happy with that.

Happy with bike and run, pacing was bob on.  May have had a little more in the tank - but more than happy with where that currently is.   Swim pace I was surprisingly OK with given most of it - however, the start shocked me, it took minutes before I could get settled in.
