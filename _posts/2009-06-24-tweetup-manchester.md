Well that was a fun evening.

Just a quick note to say we&#8217;re back from the Tweetup hosted by [Sweet Mandarin](http://www.sweetmandarin.com/). An absolute damn fine way to spend an evening: good food, good weather and good company. Lisa and co provided dim sum, a half dozen of us decided to stay for a full meal.

This is a brilliant example of how to use social media to promote your business and get it right. A few messages in the right place, and a genuine interest in people. No high and mighty pretentions, but simple ideas promoted well. I applaud you girls.

One trick they have missed&#8230; Sweet Mandarin does a Â£10 all you can eat Dim Sum at the weekends. I think they should be pushing this more, If the rest of their menu is anything to go by, this is superb value for money. If you&#8217;re in Manchester this weekend, drop by and give them a try, you won&#8217;t regret it.
