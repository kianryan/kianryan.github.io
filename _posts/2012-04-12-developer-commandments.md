I just came across an old e-mail I sent back in 2010. The tooling may have changed a bit, but the ideas still hold true:

> 1. Thou shalt not break the build.
  
> 1a. If thoust breakith the build, thoust better bloody well fix the build.
  
> 1b. If thoust not fixith the build, I will come after ye with Matilda.
  
> 1c. Thou does not want to find out what Matilda is.
  
> 2. Thou shalt not bypass the build process.
  
> (no good ever comes of it, and it \*never\* saves time in the long run)
  
> 3. Thou shalt start, stop and resolve thy JIRA tickets in a timely manner.
  
> 4. Thou shalt not put up front-end code that hath not passed the HTML/XHTML validator.
  
> 5. Thou shalt not put CSS or Javascript inline.
  
> 5a. Evar.
  
> 6. Thou shalt not reinvent the wheel.
  
> 6a. Even if your reinvented wheel floats in the air. Some poor bugger has to maintain it.
  
> 7. Thou shalt put thy faith (and all new projects) into the Holy Trinity (Subversion, CruiseControl.NET, JIRA).
  
> 7a. Without exception.
  
> 7b. Unless youâ€™ve got a very, \*very\*, \*VERY\* persuasive argument you can communicate effectively whilst being nibbled alive by rabid gerbils.
  
> 8. Thou shalt commit thy code (at least) daily.
  
> 9. Thou shalt not worship false backup files (.bak, _old, .bak.old).
  
> 9a. Thou shalt verily never commit backup files, data files or SVN metadata files into thine repository.
  
> 9b. Because I then have to spend two hours picking them back out. And that really peeves me off (see 7b for suitable punishment).
  
> 10. If in doubt, thy should ask. Itâ€™s good to talk[TM]
  
> 
  
> If in doubt remember the eleventh commandment:
  
> 11. Code as if the next guy to maintain your code is a homicidal maniac who knows where you live.
  
> 
I admit plagiarism for number 11.
