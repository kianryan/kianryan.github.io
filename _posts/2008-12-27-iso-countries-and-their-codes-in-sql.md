Had a headdesk moment as I sat down this morning to write a delivery page for a web site I&#8217;m current working on. I needed a table of countries, their ISO numbers and two and three letter codes. I&#8217;ve done this once or twice before, but had misplaced the script to rip the data from wikipedia and generate the insert statements. I thought I&#8217;d run around the web to see if anyone else had the common sense to do the same thing and plonk it on the web.

Lo and behold, the gentleman [here](http://vidmar.net/weblog/archive/2008/05/23/database-of-country-names-numeric-alpha-2-and-alpha-3-iso-codes.aspx) has already done it for us. I think he deserves a round of applause and a cup of tea for saving me ten minutes work.
