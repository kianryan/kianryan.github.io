I occasionally make insightful, if somewhat obvious posts to the [GeekUp](http://geekup.org/) community. One of my most linked to and pointed posts was in response to a common thread: [&#8220;how to set up a freelancing business&#8221;](http://groups.google.com/group/geekup/browse_thread/thread/ad52151e7b43bbe5). I formed &#8220;Kian&#8217;s Rules For Freelancing&#8221;, and present them here for your consideration. The old footnotes are recorded with numbers, the new footnotes are recorded with roman numerals.

# Kian&#8217;s Rules of Freelancing

  1. Try and hit the ground running. 
  2. The customer is not always right. They are, in many cases wrong. 
      * The customer is rarely right. Often they&#8217;re very wrong. 
      * The customer is never right. They are always wrong.<sup>[i]</sup>
  3. There are approximately 9 usable business hours in a day. Any more, and you&#8217;ll kill yourself. 
      * Those are 9 business hours. Not necessarily 9 hours coding. Some days, you will do bugger all coding. 
      * That is an average. There may be the occasional &#8220;oh shit&#8221; race condition which means that there becomes 26 business hours in a day. Remember to balance it out.<sup>[ii]</sup>
      * If you&#8217;re working less than nine hours a day, make sure the money is still coming into the pot. 
      * As Paul Robinson has observed, GeekUp, open-source projects and community are often &#8220;business&#8221;. Remember to factor that in. <sup>[iii]</sup>
  4. Try not to bite off more than you can chew. <sup>[iv]</sup> 
      * You are a developer, not a designer. If you need designs, hire a designer. 
      * You are a developer, not a network engineer. If you need network support, hire a monkey. 
      * You are a developer, not a 24-hour on-call support service<sup>[1]</sup>. If you need a 24-hour on-call support service, hire a minion. 
      * You are a developer, not a one-man army of God. You are not going to single-handedly end poverty, restore world peace and produce cool music<sup>[2]</sup>.As such, if the project looks like it needs an army, consider hiring an army.<sup>[v]</sup>

### Footnotes

[1] Unless you&#8217;re stupid enough to sign up for that.

[2] Unless you&#8217;re Bono.[3]

[3] Or me.

### New Footnotes and Annotations

[i] Usually this boils down to &#8220;the customer does not know _what_ they want&#8221;. The sign of a good freelancer is the ability to beat the client&#8217;s real requirements out of them. A stick is a tax-deductible tool.[vi]

[ii] See the past three weeks of my life for a good example of this.

[iii] When you attend these events as a regular &#8220;Joe Blogs&#8221;, an employee for something-corp, you treat these events as learning experiences, possibly networking, but generally for fun. When attending these events as a freelancer, yes you&#8217;re doing all of the above, but you&#8217;re keeping an ear/eye open for new opportunities. That takes energy. Factor it in.

[iv] Refer to One Another As I Have Referred You (refer work to others, and hopefully they will refer back to you)

[v] Projects have costs. A business has to spend money. Spend money to make money. Learn. This. Lesson.

[vi] This is not a slight on businesses. Requirements capture is by its very nature **hard**.
