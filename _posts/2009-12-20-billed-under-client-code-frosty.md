Dear client,

my apologies for not being diligently working as I probably should have been today. If you were not aware, it&#8217;s been snowing the past few days and being the rather large kid that I am, I decided that we were unable to get to the office (despite it being eight steps from my bedroom).

To compensate for this, I did something much more productive. It&#8217;s a prototype implementation of a Briggs inspired solution to the classic winter design problem:

Yep, I engineered a freakin&#8217; snowman. He&#8217;s 5ft 8in tall, a few feet across the shoulders and should hopefully last at least a few days.

Normal service will resume tomorrow.
