For our honeymoon, Cat and I spent twelve days in Florida (awesomely paid for by friends and family). Whilst there, we picked up two mugs from a target store.

These mugs:

[<img src="/assets/images/2013/03/DSCF1316-300x225.jpg" alt=""   class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-917" srcset="/assets/images/2013/03/DSCF1316-300x225.jpg 300w, /assets/images/2013/03/DSCF1316.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/assets/images/2013/03/DSCF1316.jpg)

We bought them because they were cheap (a few dollar), colourful, a good size and were adorned with funky designs. They came back with us from Florida, and they’re now our daily mugs – a little reminder of our honeymoon.

I was curious about the designs on the mugs: “The Blue Whale”, “Tall Paul”  “Gemini Giant” sounded like quite specific things. So, with the aid of the internet I did a little digging, and indeed they are. All are attractions on [Route 66](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66). The [Blue Whale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Whale_of_Catoosa) is a waterfront structure on a pond, originally built as a wedding anniversary present. The area was expanded with picnic tables and opened to the public. [Tall Paul](http://www.historic66.com/illinois/site/atlanta-bunyon-giant-tall-paul.html) and [Gemini Giant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_Giant) are [Muffler Men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffler_Man), large fibreglass characters used for advertising. The basic figure was a lumberjack holding an axe. They were customised for various uses, including Tall Paul, who holds a giant hot dog and the Gemini Giant, who wears a space helmet and holds a rocket. Both are on Route 66.

We’re now considering a trip on Route 66.
