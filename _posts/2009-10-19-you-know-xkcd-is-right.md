You know, it&#8217;s absolutely right. We&#8217;ve got so obsessed over security of liquids, toothpastes and belt buckles that people appear to have overlooked that laptops, iPods and mobile phones are potentially a hell of a lot more lethal. Maybe we should just point to all people with [beards and laptops](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stephen_Birch_-_Richard_Stallman_with_OLPC_(by).jpg) and scream &#8220;terrorist&#8221; instead.
