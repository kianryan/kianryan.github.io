I had a small revelation over the weekend.

Nothing too epic, but an important one nontheless.

I promote reuse wherever I can. I dislike having to reinvent the wheel when someone else has already done an good implementation that covers off most of the functionality I need for a given job.

For example: why reinvent your own ORM and DAL generator, when [Subsonic](http://subsonicproject.com/) does so well? Why write your own Javascript library to perform basic client side functions when [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) fills the spot so well, that even the [Blue Monster](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx) have taken it on board? And why spend the time writing your own blog engine, when there are so many good ones that are constantly maintained by a large community.

I should practice what I preach.

So, last night I finally put a halt to my blog engine. It&#8217;s undergone four or five complete rewrites and has never made it to the point I consider &#8220;production&#8221;. There are chunks of it which will get reused elsewhere, but for now it&#8217;s time to explore new projects. And so, in its void I&#8217;ve decided to use WordPress. My [partner](http://www.catashton.co.uk/) has been using WordPress for several months now, and as a blogging platform it seems reliable enough to meet my needs. I can now get on with more writing, more coding and more photography without having to worry about &#8220;oh, must get that blogging platform finished so I can post this article!&#8221;.

So this should mean you start to see more of me writing. Here&#8217;s to the Blogosphere.
