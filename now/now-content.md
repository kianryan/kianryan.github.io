## Current Reading

I'm tracking my currently reading over on [Bookwyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/user/kianryan/books/reading), part of the Fediverse.


## Sport

Sport is a little slow atm.  I'm on rehab after being in an RTA in March 2022.

## Work

I have a number of client projects on the go, but if you've got interesting projects you would like to discuss please [get in touch](http://www.orangetentacle.co.uk/).

I'm doing some interesting work with .NET, React, NodeJs, Typescript, and a whole host of Azure and AWS services.  We're having fun.

I'm doing lots of image processing at the minute, and a fair bit of work with AI services.

## Play

When I can, I'm helping out with at [Leigh Hackspace](https://en-gb.facebook.com/LeighHackspace/), and tinkering with electronics projects.  I've just finished the Psion Sidecar, and just finishing InTheDark.  Next on my desk is a vision based IOT project.
