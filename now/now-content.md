## Work

I have a number of client projects on the go, but if you've got interesting projects you would like to discuss please [get in touch](http://www.orangetentacle.co.uk/).

I'm doing some interesting work with .NET Core, React, NodeJs, Typescript, and a whole host of Azure and AWS services.  We're having fun.
