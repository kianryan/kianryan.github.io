This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page.

I stole it from [Martin Rue](https://martinrue.com/now/), who stole it from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/).

## Sport

I'm currently training for a number of 2018 triathlons and 10k road races.

I'll next be racing at the [Bolton 10K](http://www.bolton10k.org/).

## Work

I have a number of client projects on the go, but if you've got interesting projects you would like to discuss please [get in touch](http://www.orangetentacle.co.uk/).

I'm currently coaching at [Northwich](http://www.northwichfencing.co.uk/), [Marshalls](http://www.marshallfencing.co.uk/), and [Lancester University](https://lancastersu.co.uk/groups/fencing-6a8f).

I'll be shortly heading out with the U13/U15 England Epee and Sabre Team to Poland.

## Life

It's convention year, so [2018 Discworld Convention](https://2018.dwcon.org/) planning is in full swing.
