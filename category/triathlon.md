## Resources

### Books

These are books I reference on a daily/weekly/monthly basis as the season progresses.  If someone asks me for "good books" for building training plans, I start here.

* [The Triathlete's Training Bible - Joe Friel](https://www.velopress.com/books/triathletes-training-bible/) - This has been my go to resource for the past two years.  How to plan, how to train for endurance, good all round resource.  Bible is accurate.
* [Fast Track Triathlete - Matt Dixon](https://www.velopress.com/books/fast-track-triathlete/) - Specific resource on long course triathlon for time-crunched athletes.  Very good, gives details on how to design focused training plans, how to fit work/life balance and example training plans for middle and full distance triathlon.
* [Strength and Conditioning for Triathlon](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/strength-and-conditioning-for-triathlon-9781408181416/) - An excellent all-round S&C book looking at pre-hab, strength and plyometric workouts and how to build S&C programmes.

These are books that helped to either get me started, or rebuild a particular skill.  They're still on the shelf, and occasionally they'll be leant to friends, but they're not daily drivers any more.  If you're just getting started, they may be of use to you.

* [Total Immersion](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Total-Immersion-Revolutionary-Better-Faster/dp/0743253434/) - When I started a few years ago, I could not swim.  TI got me from 25m to 2k.  I've a long way to go, but if you're struggling to get started, this can help you start.
* [Chi Running](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chirunning-Revolutionary-Approach-Effortless-Injury-Free/dp/1847392784) - In 2016 I suffered a big hamstring injury and found running became a problem, my previous "brute force" style was no longer going to cut it.  So I needed to get to grips with running mechanics and start again.  Chi Running is a terrible name for a reasonable system.  Similar to TI in approach, it will "get you moving".

### Podcasts

I've struggled to find many podcasts that fit within my own requirements - I like 30-60 minute podcasts, on focused topics, ideally with little rambling.  I've been through a few, and they usually fall by the wayside.

* [Triathlete Training Podcast with Eric Schwartz](http://triathletetraining.libsyn.com/) - Not been updated since 2018, but good archive content in here.
